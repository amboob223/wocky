In React, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and immutable within the child component. Props allow you to customize and configure child components dynamically based on the data or configuration provided by the parent component.

In the example you provided, the CarouselFadeExample component accepts props such as addresses, handleAddressClick, setSelectedAddress, and setReviews. These props are passed from the parent component (Form) to the CarouselFadeExample component, allowing the child component to display a carousel with dynamic content based on the addresses passed down from the parent and handle address click events.

Here's a breakdown of the props used in the CarouselFadeExample component:

addresses: An array of addresses used to populate the carousel items.
handleAddressClick: A function passed down from the parent component to handle click events on carousel items.
setSelectedAddress: A function passed down from the parent component to set the selected address in the parent component's state.
setReviews: A function passed down from the parent component to set the reviews in the parent component's state.
By passing these props from the parent component to the child component, you enable the child component to display dynamic content and interact with the parent component in a controlled manner.
