okay we use the connect wallet shit to get the user logged in and then they can scroll through the address and see the reviews so if you hit connect wallet it getes your info
    if some one selects that person they set off the contract that will let them make a review and and updates there address 

    then on the other side we make a table that keeps track of the address and review for the person selcted 

    okay now what we need is a way to update the address of in the function with the address of the person we will do business with
            -there is a list of address and the user picks which address which then shows the subsequent reviews 
                        -allow them to be able to scrill


                today
