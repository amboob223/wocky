okay now we need to upload the photoon ipfs 
and the address maps to it and the username will go on ipfs too or sql ? i think ipfs 
to get the reviewsz to change we had to make a prop to go ub the carosuel

instead of ipfs i will use a server but after this project i will redo the nft since nft stograe switched up the format 
I think the issue im having is that we not saving the ipfs hash on the block chain or a database so in this one i will 
use database and next one will be 


right now the app lets you signup wi

we got to add
    -styling
    -payment for when a review is left 
    -we need to ensure an address is only signed in once and that all portions are filled 
    -dont put on ipfs until form submits
